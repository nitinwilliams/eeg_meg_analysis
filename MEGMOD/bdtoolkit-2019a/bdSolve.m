%bdSolve  Solve an initial-value problem using the Brain Dynamics Toolbox
%Usage:
%   sol = bdSolve(sys)
%   sol = bdSolve(sys,tspan)
%   sol = bdSolve(sys,tspan,@solverfun)
%   sol = bdSolve(sys,tspan,@solverfun,solvertype)
% where
%   sys is a system struct describing the dynamical system
%   tspan=[0 100] is the time span of the integration (optional)
%   @solverfun is a function handle to an ode/dde/sde solver (optional)
%   solvertype is a string describing the type of solver (optional).
%
%   The tspan, @solverfun and solvertype arguments are all optional.
%   If tspan is omitted then it defaults to sys.tspan.
%   If @solverfun is omitted then it defaults to the first solver in sys.
%   If @solverfun is supplied but it is not known to the sys struct then
%   you must also supply the solvertype string ('odesolver', 'ddesolver'
%   or 'sdesolver').
%
%RETURNS
%   sol is the solution structure. It has the same format as that returned
%      by the matlab ode45 solver. Use the bdEval function to extract the
%      results from sol.
%
%EXAMPLE
%   sys = LinearODE;                % Linear system of ODEs
%   tspan = [0 10];                 % integration time domain
%   sol = bdSolve(sys,tspan);       % call the solver
%   tplot = 0:0.1:10;               % time domain of interest
%   Y = bdEval(sol,tplot);          % extract/interpolate the solution
%   plot(tplot,Y);                  % plot the result
%   xlabel('time'); ylabel('y');
