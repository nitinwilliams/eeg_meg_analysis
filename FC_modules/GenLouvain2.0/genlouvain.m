function [S,Q] = genlouvain(B,limit,verbose,randord,randmove)
%GENLOUVAIN  Louvain-like community detection, specified quality function.
%   Version 2.0 (July 2014)
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B) with matrix B implements a Louvain-like greedy
%   community detection method using the modularity/quality matrix B that
%   encodes the quality function Q, defined by summing over all elements
%   B(i,j) such that nodes i and j are placed in the same community.
%   Following Blondel et al. 2008, the algorithm proceeds in two phases
%   repeated iteratively: quality is optimized by moving one node at a time
%   until no such moves improve quality; the communities found to that
%   point are then aggregated to build a new network where each node
%   represents a community.  The output vector S encodes the obtained
%   community assignments, with S(i) identifying the community to which
%   node i has been assigned.  The output Q gives the quality of the
%   resulting partition of the network.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B) with function handle B such that B(i) returns
%   the ith column of the modularity/quality matrix uses this function
%   handle (to reduce the memory footprint for large networks) until the
%   number of groups is less than 10000 and then builds the B matrix
%   corresponding to the new aggregated network in subsequent passes.  Use
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit) to change this default=10000 limit.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,0) suppresses displayed text output.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,0) forces index-ordered (cf.
%   randperm-ordered) consideration of nodes, for deterministic results.
%
%   [S,Q]=GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,randord,1) enables additional 
%   randomization to obtain a broader sample of the quality function landscape 
%   and mitigates some undesirable behavior for "multislice" modularity with 
%   ordinal coupling. Without 'randmove' enabled, the algorithm exhibits an 
%   abrupt change in behavior when the strength of the interslice coupling 
%   approaches the maximum value of the intraslice modularity matrices. With 
%   'randmove' enabled, the algorithm moves the node under consideration to a 
%   community chosen uniformly at random from all moves that increase the 
%   quality function, instead of choosing the move that maximally increases the 
%   quality function.
%
%   Example (using adjacency matrix A)
%         k = full(sum(A));
%         twom = sum(k); 
%         B = @(v) A(:,v) - k'*k(v)/twom;
%         [S,Q] = genlouvain(B); 
%         Q = Q/twom;
%     finds community assignments for the undirected network encoded by the
%     symmetric adjacency matrix A.  For small networks, one may obtain
%     reasonably efficient results even more simply by handling the full
%     modularity/quality matrix
%         B = A - k'*k/twom;
%     instead of the function handle.  Intended use also includes the
%     "multislice" network quality function of Mucha et al. 2010, where B
%     encodes the interactions as an equivalent matrix (see examples posted
%     online at http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain).
%
%   Notes:
%     The matrix represented by B must be both symmetric and square.  This
%     condition is not checked thoroughly if B is a function handle, but is
%     essential to the proper use of this routine.
%
%     Under default options, this routine can return different results from
%     run to run because it considers nodes in pseudorandom (randperm)
%     order.  Because of the potentially large number of nearly-optimal
%     partitions (Good et al. 2010), one is encouraged to investigate
%     results of repeated applications of this code (and, if possible, of
%     other computational heuristics).  To force deterministic behavior,
%     ordering nodes by their index, pass zero as the fourth input:
%     GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,0).
%
%     This algorithm is only "Louvain-like" in the sense that the two
%     phases are used iteratively in the same manner as in the Louvain
%     algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008).  Because it operates on a general
%     quality/modularity matrix B, it does not include any analytical
%     formulas for quickly identifying the change in modularity from a
%     proposed move nor any improved efficiency obtained by their use.  If
%     your problem uses one of the well-used null models included in other
%     codes, those codes should be much faster for your task.
%
%     Past versions had a problem where accumulated subtraction error might
%     lead to an infinite loop with each pass oscillating between two or
%     more partitions yet incorrectly identifying increases in quality.  We
%     believe this problem has been corrected by the relative change checks
%     in lines 178 and 269.  If you encounter a similar problem, notify
%     Peter Mucha (<a href="mailto:mucha@unc.edu">mucha@unc.edu</a>).
%
%     The output Q provides the sum over the appropriate elements of B
%     without any rescaling.  As such, we have rescaled Q in the example
%     above by 2m = sum(k) so that Q <= 1.
%
%     The '~' for ignoring function returns (used for "max" below) are not
%     supported prior to R2009b.  Replace (e.g. 'dummy') for pre-2009b.
%
%     By using this code, the user implicitly acknowledges that the authors
%     accept no liability associated with that use.  (What are you doing
%     with it anyway that might cause there to be a potential liability?!?)
